## [Update] .gitignore for App Tracking and Pycache Exclusion

### Date: [Auto-generated]

### Change:
- Updated `.gitignore` to ensure the app code is tracked by git, but the following are excluded:
  - `venv/` (virtual environment)
  - `__pycache__/` (Python bytecode cache)
  - `.env` (environment variables)
  - `*.json` (user data files)

### Command/Action:
- Edited `.gitignore` to:
  ```
  venv/
  __pycache__/
  .env
  *.json
  ```

### Reason:
- To ensure the application code is always pushed to git, but sensitive or unnecessary files (like caches and user data) are not.
