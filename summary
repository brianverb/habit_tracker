# Project Summary

This project is a modular, Flask-based Habit Tracker web application. It allows users to:
- Register and log in (per-user data)
- Add, edit, and remove habits (with custom schedules and start dates)
- View and mark habits as done/not done in an agenda or calendar view
- Use an AI-powered chat and planning interface for natural language habit management (including add, remove, and now edit habits)
- Store all user data in per-user JSON files (excluded from git)

## Version Control & .gitignore
- The `.gitignore` is configured so that all app code is tracked by git, but the following are excluded:
  - `venv/` (virtual environment)
  - `__pycache__/` (Python bytecode cache)
  - `.env` (environment variables)
  - `*.json` (user data files)

## Documentation
- All changes and commands are logged in `documentation/changes_and_commands.txt`.
- The project is organized for clarity, modularity, and privacy.
- The Smart Add feature now supports editing habits via natural language.
